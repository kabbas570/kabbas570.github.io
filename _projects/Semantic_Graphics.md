## Project Aims 
 - The semantic graphics is the idea of labeling an area of interest with the minimum human labor.
 - In our experiments,  we manually assigned a solid circle to the base of paddy and millet weed, and the rest of the pixels are counted as background.
 - This technique is useful in making labeling an easier task.
