## Abstract 
This IoS application classifies singing vs. speaking vs. silence of the last 2 seconds based on 
microphone sensor data. It utilizes a deep learning-based CNN model.

A more advanced version of this project is in progress, where the aim is to use Mobile Deep Learning for Plant/ Weed Recognition and their diseases in  remote areas.
