## Project Aims 
-  Develop an AI-based algorithm to identify different components of a transmission tower
-  Regular inspections using drones or cameras with automated detection systems can identify potential issues before they lead to failures.
-  Cost saving for the efficient and safe operation of high-voltage transmission systems.
- A short demo is [Available Here](https://keen-ai.com/blog/successfully-utilising-machine-learning-and-ai-at-a-transmission-operator/) and [Also Here](https://keen-ai.com/case-study/detecting-high-risk-distribution-poles-with-ai/)
