## Project Aims 
-  Develop a deep neural network solution for automatic corrosion detection on transmission towers
- The project involved a two-step approach where firstly, we separate the steel works against the background, followed by segmenting the Rust on the Steel
- The algorithm can work on large-scale iamges 
- A short demo is [Available Here](https://keen-ai.com/case-study/corrosion-detection-on-overhead-line-towers/)
