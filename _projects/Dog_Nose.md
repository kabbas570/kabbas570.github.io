title: "Dog-Noseprint-Recognition-and-Localization"
collection: projects
excerpt: "Dogs' nose have unique patterns as a human's fingerprints.It can be used to accurately identify the dogs species. This project exploredthe idea of "Dog Noseprint Recognition and Localization", using a hybrid CNN network for both clasification and localization."

## Project Aims 

- The proposed model identifies and localize the specific pattern in dog nose
- The network has three parts:
- CNN extracts the features from Input Image
- Regression part estimates the position of dogâ€™s nose
- Classification part predicts the dog class
