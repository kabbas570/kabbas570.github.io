title: "Dog-Noseprint-Recognition-and-Localization"
collection: projects
excerpt: "Dogs' noses have unique patterns like human fingerprints. It can be used to identify the dog species accurately. This project explored the idea of Dog Noseprint Recognition and Localization, using a hybrid CNN network for both classification and localization."

## Project Aims 

- The proposed model identifies and localizes the specific pattern in dog nose
- The network has three parts
- CNN extracts the features from the Input Image
- The regression part estimates the position of the dogâ€™s nose
- The classification part predicts the dog class
