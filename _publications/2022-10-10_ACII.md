## Abstract  
The art of understating emotions across different
cultures is a subjective experience; however, what cross-cuts
the cultural expression is our human neuro-physiological ability
to communicate our feelings via facial expressions. Combined
with AI know-how, such capacity provides us with unique
opportunities to trace the artists’ intentions to communicate
particular emotions to the viewer, from those in the deep past
c. 25,000 years ago to the contemporary sculpture. Here, we
present a computational approach to analyzing facial expressions
depicted in artwork of numerous regions, specifically sculptures.
We collected a large dataset of sculptures’ faces from online
collections of various museums and used the existing methods to
assign labels to each image. Each instance may have more than
one label predicted by different methods, so we treated facial
expression recognition as a multi-label classification problem.
We designed deep learning-based frameworks using different
backbones to categorize facial expressions in sculptures. We also
implemented GradCAM to visualize the attributes in each image
contributing the most to the predicted labels.
