## Our Contributions 
- We utilized deep learning-based methods to analyze facial expressions in sculpture faces.
- We collected images from different museums worldwide and introduced a publicly available automatically labeled dataset for the research community.
- The existing FER methods, pre-trained on human facial expressions, generate soft and multi-label classes for the collected dataset.
- We designed deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) based models, using different strategies to classify the sculptureâ€™s expressions into multiple classes.
-  We also generated coarse localization maps to visualize the important image regions that contributed to the predictions
