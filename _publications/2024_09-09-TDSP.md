## Our Contributions   
- We propose a sequential 3D-to-2D-to-3D approach for multi-view cardiac image segmentation by effectively utilizing the trans-dimensional
segmentation priors (TDSP), which transform a segmentation from one
view into another and serve as guidance.
- The TDSP provides a robust anatomical reference at the networkâ€™s
input and encourages the network to produce anatomically plausible
segmentation maps.
- We also introduce a Heart Localization and Cropping (HLC) module to
focus the segmentation on the heart region only. This strategy reduces
the computation for the second and third-stage segmentation network
and eliminates false positive predictions.
- Extensive experiments are conducted to showcase the efficacy of the
proposed pipeline utilizing the HLC module and TDSP, where our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art as well as methods on
the M&Ms-2 challenge leaderboard.
