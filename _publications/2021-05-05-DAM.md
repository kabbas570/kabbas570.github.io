## Our Contributions
 - We propose a single attention module (DAM) for channel and spatial attention and a parallel
dilated convolution module (PDC) for aggregating multi-scale context.
- We validate the effectiveness of DAM and PDC by ample ablation experiments.
- We propose an optimal location for integrating our attention module in any existing network and compare
results with other existing attention mechanisms.
- We propose a technique for visually interpreting segmentation networks by modifying Grad-CAM.
- A new dataset for the semantic segmentation of strawberries is introduced, consisting of four classes
depending on the ripeness level of the fruit.
