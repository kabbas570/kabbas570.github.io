## Our Contributions   
- We propose CroCNet, a novel two-stage architecture that
computes a first segmentation used to identify anatomies
and perform cropping on the original image. The cropped
data is fed into a second stage consisting of coupled specialist networks that perform binary segmentation.
- For the first stage of CroCNet, we propose E-2AUNet, a
novel hybrid encoder-decoder architecture that modifies a
UNet with E-2A blocks.
- In the second stage, we implement specialist networks
coupled through efficient additive cross-attention, which
acts as a soft shape prior.
- Our results set a new state-of-the-art on the M&Ms-2
dataset, outperforming the recently proposed TransFusion.
