## Our Contributions
- We introduce a novel Multi-modal Outer Arithmetic Block (MOAB) that fuses latent representations of different modalities
using arithmetic operations.
- We demonstrate MOABâ€™s ability to capture rich representations of fused data in a brain cancer application using a histology image and genetic data. Our method outperforms the previous state-of-art by producing more discriminative fused features for classification. This is also demonstrated with t-SNE plots, which visualize the improved separability of classes thanks to MOAB.
