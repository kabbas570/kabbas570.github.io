## Research Experiences 
-----------------------
**1- PhD Graduate Student Researcher** <br> 
Queen Maryâ€™s Digital Environment Research Institute &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   (April-2022  May-2025)

I worked on AI-based Cardiac Image Computing to solve cardiac-related problems using segmentation, where I incorporated different innovations into Cardiovascular Imaging using multiple state-of-the-art deep learning approaches, including CLIP, Compositional AI, designing loss functions for segmentation, and Multi-Modal AI.

**2- Research Intern** <br> 
KeenAI    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (June-2022  Dec-2024)

Developing AI-based approaches to segment corrosion on steelworks using images of transmission towers. The project aimed to precisely predict the steelwork on various backgrounds and then estimate the proportion of corrosion. The images are collected through drones, helicopters, and simulations (synthetic data) to train the algorithms. This project had been shortlisted for the IAM Asset Management Excellence Awards 2023 - UK and IET Excellence and Innovation Awards in AI and Robotics.

**3- Research Assistant** <br> 
NIHR Barts Biomedical Research Centre, London    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (December-2023  Sep-2024)

I worked on innovating cardiac digital twins to model acute coronary syndromes, transcatheter aortic valve replacement, and hypertension. My research themes included RNN-based blood pressure prediction, large-scale data cleaning, and developing an aorta segmentation algorithm.

**4- Research Assistant** <br> 
University of Cambridge, McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Oct-2021  April-2022)

I worked on computational recognition of facial expressions in visual arts. The project's goals included gathering a small training dataset of sculptures to analyze their emotional content, utilizing existing facial expression algorithms to assess the emotional potency of art, and developing novel ideas to predict facial expressions. We proposed a multi-label classification approach
to predict ambivalent facial expressions in sculptures.

**5- MS-Graduate Student Researcher** <br>
Core Research Institute of Intelligent Robots, Jeonbuk National University, Republic of Korea   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Sep-2019  Oct-2021)

I worked on different projects related to medical image processing and smart farming using state-of-the-art computer vision algorithms to solve problems like classification, object detection, depth estimation, and segmentation for precision agriculture and healthcare. My research aimed to design efficient deep learning modules for real-time applications by reducing the algorithms' parameterized complexity and inference time.
