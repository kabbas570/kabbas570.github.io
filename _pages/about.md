I am a third-year PhD student at Queen Mary University of London, working on Cardiac Image Segmentation using deep learning. My PhD is supervised by [Professor Greg Slabaugh](https://eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~gslabaugh/), [Professor Martin Benning](https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/95169-martin-benning), [Dr. Caroline Roney](https://www.sems.qmul.ac.uk/staff/c.roney/), and [Dr. Muhammad Asad](https://masadcv.github.io/).

My PhD is funded by the mini-CTD program of the Queen Mary University of London through industrial partners, including NVIDIA Corporation, Circle Cardiovascular Imaging, and Conavi Medical. I am also part of [Queen Mary's Digital Environment Research Institute](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/deri/deri-people/deri-students/profiles-/abbas-khan-rayabat-khan.html).

  I am also a [Research Intern at KeenAI](https://keen-ai.com/about/). My work focuses on developing AI-based approaches to segment steelwork and rust accurately in transmission tower images. The work aims to predict steelwork and estimate rust proportions across various backgrounds.

The image below summarizes my PhD research journey (Deep learning-based Cardiac Image Segmentation ) since April 2022.
