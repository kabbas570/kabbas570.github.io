I am a third-year PhD student at Queen Mary University of London, working on Cardiac Image Segmentation using deep learning. My PhD is supervised by [Professor Greg Slabaugh](https://eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~gslabaugh/), [Professor Martin Benning](https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/95169-martin-benning), [Dr. Caroline Roney](https://www.sems.qmul.ac.uk/staff/c.roney/), and [Dr. Muhammad Asad](https://masadcv.github.io/).

My PhD is funded by the mini-CTD program of the Queen Mary University of London through industrial partners, including NVIDIA Corporation, Circle Cardiovascular Imaging, and Conavi Medical. I am also part of [Queen Mary's Digital Environment Research Institute](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/deri/deri-people/deri-students/profiles-/abbas-khan-rayabat-khan.html).

  I am also a [Research Intern at KeenAI](https://keen-ai.com/about/). My work focuses on developing AI-based approaches to segment steelwork and rust accurately in transmission tower images. The work aims to predict steelwork and estimate rust proportions across various backgrounds.
