I am a Postdoctoral Scientist at [Johnson & Johnson](https://www.jnj.com/), working at the intersection of multi-modal AI and drug discovery.

I recently defended my PhD at Queen Mary University of London, where I worked on Cardiac Image Segmentation using deep learning. My PhD was supervised by [Professor Greg Slabaugh](https://eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~gslabaugh/), [Professor Martin Benning](https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/95169-martin-benning), [Dr. Caroline Roney](https://www.sems.qmul.ac.uk/staff/c.roney/), and [Dr. Muhammad Asad](https://masadcv.github.io/).

My PhD was funded by the mini-CTD program at Queen Mary University of London, with industrial partners, including NVIDIA Corporation, Circle Cardiovascular Imaging, and Conavi Medical. I was also part of [Queen Mary's Digital Environment Research Institute](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/deri/deri-people/deri-students/profiles-/abbas-khan-rayabat-khan.html).

I was also a [Research Intern at KeenAI](https://keen-ai.com/about/). My work focused on developing AI-based approaches to segment steelwork and rust accurately in transmission tower images. The work aimed to predict steelwork and estimate rust proportions across various backgrounds.

Previously, I was fortunate to work at the University of Cambridge with [Liliana Janik](https://www.arch.cam.ac.uk/directory/lj102) and [Hatice Gunes](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~hg410/) at [Affective Intelligence & Robotics Lab](https://cambridge-afar.github.io/). I also had the privilege to work at [Core Research Institute of Intelligent Robots](https://robot.jbnu.ac.kr/robot/index.do), where I completed my Master's Degree under the supervision of [Hyongsuk Kim](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ywYodqAAAAAJ&hl=en).
